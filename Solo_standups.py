***SOLO STANDUP*** 
by Kai PietilÃ¤

A program to record some plans on what to code the this session. 
You can review your entries later via the program

Name comes from when you at a comapny perform standups with your squad to see
what needs to be done etc each morning. 
Created this to have some nice log to follow my own coding and to keep some record for
myself.

Still needed features for full intended funtionality: 
- Add TinyDB to be able to use the entries for more stuff, search etc. To be able 
  to show an amount of entries on command.
